# AltspaceVR Engineering Project - SDK Tutorial

## Instructions

In this project, you will upgrade an existing SDK example and write a tutorial about the process. 

## Goals

We use this test to get a sense of how you communicate technical concepts and to get a basic sense of your coding ability.  
When we receive your project, here is what we will be asking ourselves:

- Is the example upgraded in a way that would capture someone's interest?
- Are modifications to the example matching, or better yet, improving the quality of the code?
- Is your tutorial compelling and easy to follow? 
- Does it seem like a developer would learn from it? (even better, did we learn something from it?)

# Part 1 - Upgrade an Example

You will be upgrading an example in the [SDK repo](https://github.com/AltspaceVR/AltspaceSDK), so start by forking the repo and cloning a local copy. The existing [Getting Started](https://developer.altvr.com/get-started/) page should help you get your development environment running.

For the sake of this project, we are considering that a hypothetical tutorial series has already been started. The existing example you pick will be considered the completed steps of tutorial #3 in this series. The upgrades you make (and the matching tutorial) will be considered tutorial #4. 

As a seed, some potential options for upgrades are:
- Add another feature from three.js
- Utilize another [Altspace API](http://altspacevr.github.io/AltspaceSDK/doc/)
- Integrate a useful third-party library
- Restructure the code in a specifically better way

These modifications do not need to be extensive, but they should be involved enough to demonstrate your abilities.

# Part 2 - Write a Matching Tutorial

Your intention in the tutorial should be to teach a SDK developer the new APIs, libraries, or techniques you are using in your upgrade. 

You have two options for creating your tutorial. 
1) Use Markdown (http://dillinger.io/ is a pretty decent editor)
2) Create a webpage and send us a link. 

## Deliverable

Your deliverable should be a fork of the SDK repo. If you decided to use Markdown for your tutorial, feel free to just clobber the exisitng README.md with your tutorial file. If you decided to host your tutorial as an external page, simply clobber the README.md contents with a link to your page.

E-mail us a link to your Github repo to `projects@altvr.com`. Please include your contact information, and if you haven't submitted it to us already, your resume and cover letter. 

We hope you have fun working on the project, and we can't wait to see what you come up with!
